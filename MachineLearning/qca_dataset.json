    "question": "What is the core innovation of LoRA and how does it address the parameter efficiency problem?",
    "context": "We propose Low-Rank Adaptation, or LoRA, which freezes the pre-trained model weights and injects trainable rank decomposition matrices into each layer of the Transformer architecture, greatly reducing the number of trainable parameters for downstream tasks. Compared to GPT-3 175B fine-tuned with Adam, LoRA can reduce the number of trainable parameters by 10,000 times and the GPU memory requirement by 3 times.",
    "answer": "LoRA freezes pre-trained weights and adds small trainable low-rank decomposition matrices to each layer, reducing trainable parameters by up to 10,000× while maintaining performance."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is the LoRA reparameterization mathematically formulated?",
    "context": "For a pre-trained weight matrix W0 ∈ R^(d×k), we constrain its update byposition W0 + ΔW = W0 + BA, where B ∈ R^(d×r), A ∈ R^(r×k), and the rank r ≪ min(d, k). During training, W0 is frozen and does not receive gradient updates, while A and B contain trainable parameters.",
    "answer": "LoRA represents weight updates as ΔW = BA where B∈R^(d×r) and A∈R^(r×k) with rank r much smaller than the original dimensions, keeping W0 frozen."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the modified forward pass equation when using LoRA?",
    "context": "Note both W0 and ΔW = BA are multiplied with the same input, and their respective output vectors are summed coordinate-wise. For h = W0x, our modified forward pass yields: h = W0x + ΔWx = W0x + BAx",
    "answer": "The forward pass becomes h = W0x + BAx, where the original frozen weights W0x are added to the low-rank adaptation BAx."
  },
  {
    "question": "How are the LoRA matrices A and B initialized and why?",
    "context": "We use a random Gaussian initialization for A and zero for B, so ΔW = BA is zero at the beginning of training. We then scale ΔWx by α/r, where α is a constant in r.",
    "answer": "Matrix A is initialized with random Gaussian values, B is initialized to zero so ΔW starts at zero, and outputs are scaled by α/r where α is a rank-dependent constant."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why does LoRA introduce no additional inference latency?",
    "context": "When deployed in production, we can explicitly compute and store W = W0 + BA and perform inference as usual. Note that both W0 and BA are in R^(d×k). When we need to switch to another downstream task, we can recover W0 by subtracting BA and then adding a different B'A', a quick operation with very little memory overhead.",

    "question": "Which weight matrices in the Transformer architecture does LoRA typically target?",
    "context": "In the Transformer architecture, there are four weight matrices in the self-attention module (Wq, Wk, Wv, Wo) and two in the MLP module. We limit our study to only adapting the attention weights for downstream tasks and freeze the MLP modules (so they are not trained in downstream tasks) both for simplicity and parameter-efficiency.",

  {
    "question": "What memory and storage benefits does LoRA provide for large models?",
    "context": "For a large Transformer trained with Adam, we reduce that VRAM usage by up to 2/3 if r ≪ dmodel as we do not need to store the optimizer states for the frozen parameters. On GPT-3 175B, we reduce the VRAM consumption during training from 1.2TB to 350GB. With r = 4 and only the query and value projection matrices being adapted, the checkpoint size is reduced by roughly 10,000× (from 350GB to 35MB).",

  {
    "question": "How does the paper formulate the parameter-efficient adaptation problem?",
    "context": "In this paper, we adopt a more parameter-efficient approach, where the task-specific parameter increment ΔΦ = ΔΦ(Θ) is further encoded by a much smaller-sized set of parameters Θ with |Θ| ≪ |Φ0|. The task of finding ΔΦ thus becomes optimizing over Θ: max_Θ Σ_{(x,y)∈Z} Σ_{t=1}^{|y|} log(p_{Φ0+ΔΦ(Θ)}(yt|x, y<t))",

  {
    "question": "What limitations do existing adapter methods have according to the paper?",
    "context": "Adapter layers have to be processed sequentially. This makes a difference in the online inference setting where the batch size is typically as small as one. In a generic scenario without model parallelism, such as running inference on GPT-2 medium on a single GPU, we see a noticeable increase in latency when using adapters, even with a very small bottleneck dimension.",
    "answer": "Adapter layers introduce sequential processing overhead, causing significant inference latency especially in online scenarios with small batch sizes."

    "question": "What problems does the paper identify with prefix tuning approaches?",
    "context": "We observe that prefix tuning is difficult to optimize and that its performance changes non-monotonically in trainable parameters, confirming similar observations in the original paper. More fundamentally, reserving a part of the sequence length for adaptation necessarily reduces the sequence length available to process a downstream task.",
    "answer": "Prefix tuning is difficult to optimize, shows non-monotonic performance with more parameters, and reduces available sequence length for actual task processing."

LoRA performs better than prior approaches, including full fine-tuning.",
    "answer": "LoRA matches or exceeds full fine-tuning performance on GPT-3 175B across WikiSQL, MultiNLI, and SAMSum while using drastically fewer parameters."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which attention weight matrices should be adapted with LoRA according to the empirical study?",
    "context": "Note that putting all the parameters in ΔWq or ΔWk results in significantly lower performance, while adapting both Wq and Wv yields the best result. This suggests that even a rank of four captures enough information in ΔW such that it is preferable to adapt more weight matrices than adapting a single type of weights with a larger rank.",
    "answer": "Adapting both Wq and Wv simultaneously yields the best performance, suggesting it's better to adapt multiple matrices with lower rank than a single matrix with higher rank."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the optimal rank r for LoRA according to the experimental results?",
    "context": "Table 6 shows that, surprisingly, LoRA already performs competitively with a very small r (more so for {Wq, Wv} than just Wq). This suggests the update matrix ΔW could have a very small 'intrinsic rank'. To our surprise, a rank as small as one suffices for adapting both Wq and Wv on these datasets while training Wq alone needs a larger r.",

ΔWq) of Ar=64 share a subspace of dimension 1 with normalized similarity > 0.5, providing an explanation of why r = 1 performs quite well in our downstream tasks for GPT-3.",

  },
  {
    "question": "How does the adaptation matrix ΔW relate to the original weights W?",
    "context": "First, ΔW has a stronger correlation with W compared to a random matrix, indicating that ΔW amplifies some features that are already in W. Second, instead of repeating the top singular directions of W, ΔW only amplifies directions that are not emphasized in W. Third, the amplification factor is rather huge: 21.5 ≈ 6.91/0.32 for r = 4.",

  },
  {
    "question": "How does LoRA generalize the concept of full fine-tuning?",
    "context": "A more general form of fine-tuning allows the training of a subset of the pre-trained parameters. LoRA takes a step further and does not require the accumulated gradient update to weight matrices to have full-rank during adaptation. This means that when applying LoRA to all weight matrices and training all biases, we roughly recover the expressiveness of full fine-tuning by setting the LoRA rank r to the rank of the pre-trained weight matrices.",
    "answer": "LoRA generalizes fine-tuning by removing the full-rank constraint on weight updates; with sufficient rank, it can recover the expressiveness of full fine-tuning."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the mathematical formulation for the number of trainable parameters in LoRA?",
    "context": "The number of trainable parameters is determined by the rank r and the shape of the original weights: |Θ| = 2 × L̂LoRA × dmodel × r, where L̂LoRA is the number of weight matrices we apply LoRA to.",

The gap between prefix-based approaches and LoRA/Fine-tuning becomes smaller as we increase the number of training examples, which might suggest that prefix-based approaches are not suitable for low-data tasks in GPT-3.",

    "question": "Can LoRA be combined with other parameter-efficient methods?",
    "context": "LoRA is orthogonal to many prior methods and can be combined with many of them, such as prefix-tuning. LoRA+PE significantly outperforms both LoRA and prefix-embedding tuning on WikiSQL, which indicates that LoRA is somewhat orthogonal to prefix-embedding tuning.",
    "answer": "Yes, LoRA can be combined with other methods like prefix-tuning, and LoRA+PrefixEmbed shows improved performance, indicating orthogonal benefits."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the main limitations of LoRA identified in the paper?",
    "context": "LoRA also has its limitations. For example, it is not straightforward to batch inputs to different tasks with different A and B in a single forward pass, if one chooses to absorb A and B into W to eliminate additional inference latency. Though it is possible to not merge the weights and dynamically choose the LoRA modules to use for samples in a batch for scenarios where latency is not critical.",
    "answer": "LoRA cannot easily batch inputs from different tasks in a single forward pass when weights are merged, though dynamic module selection is possible when latency is not critical."

  {
    "question": "What baseline methods does the paper compare against?",
    "context": "Fine-Tuning (FT) is a common approach for adaptation. Bias-only or BitFit is a baseline where we only train the bias vectors while freezing everything else. Prefix-embedding tuning (PreEmbed) inserts special tokens among the input tokens. Prefix-layer tuning (PreLayer) is an extension to prefix-embedding tuning. Adapter tuning as proposed in Houlsby et al. (2019) inserts adapter layers between the self-attention module.",

  },
  {
    "question": "How does the scaling factor α work in LoRA?",
    "context": "We then scale ΔWx by α/r, where α is a constant in r. When optimizing with Adam, tuning α is roughly the same as tuning the learning rate if we scale the initialization appropriately. As a result, we simply set α to the first r we try and do not tune it. This scaling helps to reduce the need to retune hyperparameters when we vary r.",
    "answer": "The scaling factor α/r normalizes the contribution of ΔW; α is set to the first rank tried and not tuned, reducing hyperparameter sensitivity when varying rank."

    "question": "What training throughput improvements does LoRA provide?",
    "context": "We also observe a 25% speedup during training on GPT-3 175B compared to full fine-tuning as we do not need to calculate the gradient for the vast majority of the parameters. For GPT-3 175B, the training throughput for full fine-tuning is 32.5 tokens/s per V100 GPU; with the same number of weight shards for model parallelism, the throughput is 43.1 tokens/s per V100 GPU for LoRA.",

  },
  {
    "question": "What is the amplification factor concept in LoRA analysis?",
    "context": "One can naturally consider a feature amplification factor as the ratio ∥ΔW∥F/∥U⊤WV⊤∥F, where U and V are the left- and right-singular matrices of the SVD decomposition of ΔW. As shown in Section 7.3, for r = 4, this amplification factor is as large as 20.",

    "context": "There are many directions for future works. 1) LoRA can be combined with other efficient adaptation methods, potentially providing orthogonal improvement. 2) The mechanism behind fine-tuning or LoRA is far from clear – how are features learned during pre-training transformed to do well on downstream tasks? 3) We mostly depend on heuristics to select the weight matrices to apply LoRA to. Are there more principled ways to do it?",
    "answer": "Future work includes combining LoRA with other methods, understanding the adaptation mechanism better, and developing principled approaches for selecting which matrices to adapt."

  {
    "question": "How does LoRA compare to adapter methods in terms of latency?",
    "context": "The inference latency introduced by adapter layers can be significant in an online, short-sequence-length scenario. Larger batch size and sequence length help to mitigate the latency, but the slow-down can be as high as over 30% in an online, short-sequence-length scenario.",
